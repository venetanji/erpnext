#Website Security

One can easily generate a website using erpnext. We can list out Products on the website and also create blogs. Products are directly fetched from the Item Master records of your erpnext account. some people would like to limit the access of the website generated by ERPNext to certain people. This is because some of the items may not be available to public.

Well at the moment this feature is not available. You cannot limit the access of the website generated by ERPNext to certain people. If you publish the website it will be publicly visible. However while you cannot control who can view the website, you can always choose which items to display on the website. To show or not show an Item on your website go to 'Item Master' and in the Item form check the 'show in website' checkbox.
